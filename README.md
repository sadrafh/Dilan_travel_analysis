## Project Motivation 

Dilan is a world traveler and a solo entrepreneur. He writes a travel blog where he sells info products: a `$8 ` e-book (World Travelers' Best Practices) and a `$80 ` video course (How To Travel the World).

On his blog he has thousands of readers every day, coming from three sources: Reddit, SEO and AdWords.

Dilan writes about his travel experiences covering the 6 main continents of the planet - these are the main categories on the blog.

The business strategy is simple:(1) New readers visit the blog, (2) They read articles, (3) They subscribe to the newsletter,(4)They purchase the info products.

Dilan's travel blog is available in 8 (and only 8) different countries. The marketing budget is not too high at the moment: Dilan spends only $ 1000 a month combined:

`1) Adwords advertisement (~$500 a month for paid ads)`,

`2) SEO($ 250 a month for editing) and`

`3) Reddit (~$250 for content creation)`

`4) And he only has two products!`

He wants to invest more (time, work and money) and that is the reason of this project! 

This analysis aims to adrdress three questions:

`1) What is the startegy for each category based on the number of vistors?`;

`2) In which country should he prioritise his effort and why `;

`3) What will be revenue of Dilan based on the user id of visitors?`.
